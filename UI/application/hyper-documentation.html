	<h2>Live Development of Mobile Apps</h2>
	
	<p>HyperReload is a live development tool, designed for development of mobile apps using web technologies. Use HTML5 technologies and JavaScript to develop mobile web apps or hybrid apps - with very fast turn around time.</p>
	
	<p>HyperReload is a sidekick that live enables your favourite web development tools. Use any text editor or graphical editor to author HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As soon as you save, the app is instantly reloaded, and you can directly see the result. This also works with image editors.</p>
	
	<p>When you start HyperReload, it runs a server, listening for connections. You can connect from any mobile device that has a web browser, and you can also use a desktop browser.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	
	<p><b>Very quick version:</b></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Click the "Run" button! If there is no browser or device connected, a web browser will be opened with the selected project.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>Slightly longer version:</b></p>
	<ul>
	<li>You can also open a web browser manually, and enter the URL shown in the bottom panel of the HyperReload window. This way you can connect from a browser on any device. <b>Mobile devices must be on the same WiFi network as this computer to be able connect!</b></li>
	<li>The browser should now connect to HyperReload and display the message "Connected".</li>
	<li>Now go to the HyperReload window, and click the "Run" button of one of the demo apps. Does the web browser display the app you selected? If so, you are up and running!</li>
	<li>On a browser running on the same machine as HyperReload, you can also try to connect using the URL: localhost:4042</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Note that this is an early version of HyperReload for testing. It displays a debug toolbar that is not part of the actual HyperReload user interface.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
	<h2>Live Editing</h2>
	<p>To test the live editing feature of HyperReload, try out the following:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Click the "Open" button of one of the demo apps in the HyperReload window, for instance the "Hello World" example.</li>
	<li>Open the file "index.html" in a text editor.</li>
	<li>Change something in the HTML code, for example, change the h1 heading to: &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;</li>
	<li>Save the file. The changes you made should be displayed in the browser.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
	
<div class="box">
	<h2>Going Mobile</h2>
	<p>HyperReload is designed for mobile development. Follow these steps to connect from a mobile device:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Important: Your mobile phone or tablet must have a WiFi connection, and be on the same local network as the computer running HyperReload.</li>
	<li>Open the web browser on your mobile phone or tablet.</li>
	<li>Enter the address displayed in the bottom panel of the HyperReload window. For example: 192.168.0.100:4042<br/>(Note that the actual address will vary dependent on the network you are connected to.)</li>
	<li>If the mobile connects successfully "Connected" is displayed.</li>
	<li>Now click "Run" in HyperReload to run a project on the device.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>You can connect from as many devices as you want. :) Any updates and changes you make will be visible on all connected browsers and devices.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
	<h2>Creating Your Own Project</h2>
	<p>To add your own project to HyperReload, do this:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Open the folder with the HTML file that is the main file of your application (typically "index.html", but any name is fine). The file must be a valid HTML file and it must have extension ".html" or ".htm".</li>
	<li>Drag the file into the HyperReload window and drop it there.</li>
	<li>The file is now added as a project to HyperReload and you can run it.</li>
	<li>You can move project entries using drag and drop, and delete them by clicking the delete icon (this will not delete any files in your project folder).</li>
	<li>When clicking "Run" the files in that project folder is monitored, and the app is reloaded when any file is updated. Currently up to three levels of subdirectories uare monitored. Future versions of HyperReload will make it possible to configure this.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="box">
<h2>Connecting from Web Apps and Hybrid Apps</h2>

<p>Connect from any web browser or web view widget using the URL displayed in the HyperReload window. For example:</p>

<pre>http://192.168.43.226:4042</pre>
    
<p>Here is an example of how to connect from an Android WebView:</p>

<pre>WebView mWebView = new WebView(this);
mWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient());
mWebView.loadUrl("http://192.168.43.226:4042");</pre>

<p>Make sure the WebView has JavaScript enabled, and that it has a WebViewClient (otherwise, URLs opened from within the WebView will be opened in an external browser, rather than in the WebView itself).</p>
